        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Eggs: This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Flour: All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
            <li> Milk: Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
            <li> Oil: A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
            <li>Sugar: A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
            <li>Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
            <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
            <li> Vanilla: A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
             <li>Cooking spray: You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
